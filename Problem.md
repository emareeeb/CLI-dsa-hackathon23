In this hackathon challenge, participants are tasked with improving the efficiency and safety of an air traffic control system. The goal is to design and implement data structures that can enhance the management of aircraft movements and ensure the smooth flow of air traffic while prioritizing safety.

Specific tasks for participants include, but are not limited to:

Developing data structures for tracking the positions and trajectories of aircraft in real-time.
Designing algorithms for collision detection and resolution to prevent mid-air collisions.
Creating a system that can efficiently route aircraft to their destinations, considering factors like fuel efficiency, weather conditions, and airspace congestion.
Implementing features for monitoring and controlling the airspace, such as sectorization and conflict resolution.
Ensuring the system can scale to handle a high volume of incoming and outgoing flights with minimal delays.
Balancing the trade-off between minimizing delays and maintaining the highest levels of safety.
Participants are encouraged to consider real-world constraints, such as communication delays, airspace regulations, and varying aircraft performance characteristics, in their solutions. The final project should demonstrate a deep understanding of data structures , as well as their practical application in optimizing air traffic control systems.

The project will be evaluated based on the ability to improve the efficiency and safety of air traffic control, as well as the elegance of the data structures employed. The objective is to showcase the power of well-designed data structures in a critical domain like air traffic control.
